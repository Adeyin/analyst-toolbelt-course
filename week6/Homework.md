# Homework Tableau

You owe two files:

Do the main examples in the Intro video (“Demarrage") and upload a PDF of your workbook. (Points for completeness!) See end of my [Tableau Intro](Tableau.mc)  for how to export PDFs. (Yes, it will look bad as an export. I’m looking for evidence you did the examples.)

In a new Tableau workbook, connect to an excel or CSV sheet we have used in class and make 4 new charts that show interesting things. Points for finding things that are interesting to show! Make sure they have descriptive titles. Save them individually into a PPT or Word document, and convert it to PDF.  Upload that too.
