## Data Journalism

Stepping thru a data story:

* The "Stepper" is just like Tableau's text buttons in a story: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/02/04/science/girls-lead-in-science-exam-but-not-in-the-united-states.html

## Data Exploration for your in-class and project work:

look for

* Outliers - values very different from the rest
* Groups (by continent, year, etc)
* Trends over time
* Top N (10, 20…)
* Calculate Differences (gain - loss, etc)

If you find something interesting, then look into WHY. (Dive deeper.)

### Outliers: How to "Use" Them In a Story

If you have multiple outliers, what makes them similar or surprising?

### Groups - Can You Find or Make Them?

Coloring countries by a few categories so you can compare the groups:

Sometimes the data reveal a pattern you can then "explain" or work with further:

### Calculate Differences

### Ask Yourself, like a Journalist:

* Who, what, when, why, where…
* Summarize all the data (histograms too)
* Are there any surprises?
* If so, what if you dive into that group/category/time period deeper.

## Hans Rosling

The most famous example of storytelling: [Hans Rosling's video](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?language=en)

He relies on
* animation
* and narration
* and pointing at parts of the graph.  Especially outliers.

What if you have static (not animated) charts?  What points would you show?
Let’s try it…  When you watch it, I want you to take notes on the "main points" he makes.  What are the story points if you made it as a static story?

This is an in-class exercise to turn in. (Put your name on your paper legibly.)
